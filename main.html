          <h4>The timeline of Alan Turing's life:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1912 </b>- Born on 23 June 1912 in Maida Vale, London</li>
            <li><b>1926 </b>- Was sent to Sherborne School, a large boarding school in Dorset</li>
            <li><b>1931 - 1934 </b>- Wons a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, and took the Mathematics degree with distinction</li>
            <li><b>1935 </b>- Elected a fellow of King's College, Cambridge</li>
            <li><b>1936 </b>- Published a paper that is now recognised as a foundation of computer science (On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem). In it Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof
              and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. He invented the idea of a ‘Universal Machine’ that could decode and perform
              any set of instructions.</li>
            <li><b>1936 - 1938 </b>- Studied at Princeton University and recived his Ph.D.</li>
            <li><b>1939 - 1940 </b>- Return to Cambridge. Introduced to German Enigma cipher machine. Turing, joined by other mathematicians at Bletchley Park, rapidly developed a new machine (the ‘Bombe’) capable of breaking Enigma messages on an industrial
              scale.
            </li>
            <li><b>1944 </b>- Worked on other technical innovations, such as a system to encrypt and decrypt spoken telephone conversations</li>
            <li><b>1945 </b>- Was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where he worked on what he sometimes described as an ‘electronic brain’</li>
            <li><b>1946 </b>- Produced a detailed design for what was called the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE.) It was a digital computer in the modern sense, storing programs in its memory.</li>
            <li><b>1948 </b>- Moves to Manchester and works for former Victoria University of Manchester, now University of Manchester</li>
            <li><b>1950 </b>- He published a philosophical paper including the idea of an ‘imitation game’ for comparing human and machine outputs, now called the Turing Test. This paper remains his best known work and was a key contribution to the field
              of Artificial Intelligence.</li>
            <li><b>1951 </b>- Turned to a new scientific project, the problem of understanding the biological patterns – spots, stripes, flower petals – of nature. He proposed an explanation in terms of chemical interactions and developed equations for them.
            </li>
            <li><b>1952 </b>- Was prosecuted as a homosexual when an affair with a young man came to the notice of the police as all male homosexual activity was illegal until 1967. His security clearance was revoked, ending ongoing work with the government
              code-breaking department.</li>
            <li><b>1954 </b>- Was defined as a security risk, harassed by police surveillance. Later on found dead in bed, died from cyanide poisoning the day before.The coroner’s verdict was suicide. </li>
          </ul>
